# Open Weather API test app
#### Adam Paul

Project structure:

  - A js folder with scripts.js, containing a handful of helper functions
  - A css folder containing my stylesheet (css, although I normally use Less) and a stylesheet for a loading animation
  - An images folder full of city pictures
  - index.html

Known defects (because QA is cool, and so is honesty):
  - For screen widths below 992px, the background image only repeats twice, instead of filling the entire height of the background.
  - For screen widths below 992px, clicking a Forecast button scrolls you back to the top. I think this might be a Bootstrap problem.
  - Sometimes the forecast API call will return a 502. That's not really under my control, but it happened to me a few times.
